# Frontend Developer Interview Answers

## General Frontend Development

1. **What is the difference between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?**  
   **HTML** provides the structure of a web page. **CSS** handles the visual appearance and layout. **JavaScript** adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.

2. **How do browsers render web pages?**  
   Browsers parse HTML to build the DOM tree, apply CSS to compute styles, construct the render tree, and then paint the pixels on the screen. JavaScript can modify the DOM and CSSOM.

3. **Explain the concept of responsive web design.**  
   Responsive web design ensures websites look and function well on all devices by using fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries to adapt layouts.

4. **What is the box model in CSS?**  
   The box model describes how elements are rendered: content, padding, border, and margin.

5. **How do you ensure cross-browser compatibility?**  
   Use feature detection (not browser detection), CSS resets, modern frameworks, and test on multiple browsers. Use vendor prefixes where necessary.

6. **How do you optimize a web page for performance?**  
   Minimize HTTP requests, optimize images, use lazy loading, minify assets, leverage caching, and defer non-critical JavaScript.

7. **What is the difference between block, inline, and inline-block elements?**  
   Block elements take full width and start on a new line. Inline elements fit within a line. Inline-block elements behave like inline but accept width/height.

8. **Explain “progressive enhancement” and “graceful degradation.”**  
   Progressive enhancement builds the base experience for all browsers, then adds features for capable browsers. Graceful degradation builds for modern browsers, then ensures basic functionality on older ones.

9. **What is accessibility (a11y) in frontend development?**  
   Designing web content usable by all, including people with disabilities, by following standards like WCAG and using semantic HTML and ARIA.

10. **How do you handle browser-specific CSS issues?**  
    Use vendor prefixes, feature queries (`@supports`), conditional comments, or fallbacks. Test on multiple browsers.

11. **What tools do you use for debugging frontend issues?**  
    Browser DevTools (Chrome, Firefox), React DevTools, Redux DevTools, and linters.

12. **Explain the concept of “critical rendering path.”**  
    The sequence of steps the browser takes to convert HTML, CSS, and JS into pixels on the screen. Optimizing it improves page load speed.

13. **What are semantic HTML tags?**  
    Tags that convey meaning about their content (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`), improving accessibility and SEO.

14. **How do you approach mobile-first design?**  
    Start designing and coding for the smallest screen sizes, then add enhancements for larger screens using media queries.

15. **What are CSS preprocessors? Have you used any?**  
    Tools like SASS or LESS that extend CSS with variables, nesting, and functions. Yes, I have used SASS for better code organization.

16. **What are CSS custom properties (variables)?**  
    Native variables in CSS (e.g., `--main-color: #333;`) that allow dynamic theming and reuse.

17. **How do you manage large CSS codebases?**  
    Use modular architecture (e.g., BEM, SMACSS), CSS preprocessors, and component-based styling (like CSS Modules or styled-components).

18. **What is BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology?**  
    A naming convention for CSS classes: Block (`.button`), Element (`.button__icon`), Modifier (`.button--large`) to improve readability and maintainability.

19. **How do you organize your project’s folder structure?**  
    By feature or component, separating concerns (e.g., `/components`, `/styles`, `/assets`, `/utils`), keeping related files together.

20. **What is Webpack? Why is it used?**  
    A module bundler for JavaScript applications, used to bundle JS, CSS, and assets, and optimize builds for production.

21. **Describe the difference between SSR and CSR.**  
    SSR (Server-Side Rendering): HTML is generated on the server. CSR (Client-Side Rendering): HTML is generated in the browser via JavaScript.

22. **How do you handle version control in your projects?**  
    Using Git for source control, branching for features/bugfixes, pull requests for code reviews, and clear commit messages.

23. **What is the purpose of a package manager like npm or yarn?**  
    To manage project dependencies, install/update packages, and handle versioning.

24. **How do you handle state management in frontend apps?**  
    For simple apps, use React’s useState/useContext; for complex apps, use Redux, Zustand, or other state management libraries.

25. **How do you manage environment variables in frontend projects?**  
    Store them in `.env` files, use build tools like Next.js or Create React App to inject variables at build time, and never commit secrets.

## React.js – Questions and Answers

**26. What are the main features of React.js?**  
Component-based architecture, virtual DOM, one-way data binding, declarative UI, reusable components, lifecycle methods, and support for hooks.

**27. Explain the concept of the virtual DOM.**  
The virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM. React updates the virtual DOM first, calculates the differences (diffing), and then efficiently updates only the changed parts in the real DOM, improving performance.

**28. What is JSX and why is it used?**  
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code in JavaScript. It makes defining UI structures easier and more readable, and it’s compiled to React.createElement calls.

**29. What are functional components vs class components?**  
Functional components are plain JavaScript functions that return JSX and manage logic using hooks. Class components are ES6 classes that extend React.Component and use lifecycle methods and state.

**30. What are React hooks? Name a few commonly used hooks.**  
Hooks are functions that let you use state and lifecycle features in functional components. Common hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext, useMemo, useCallback, useRef.

**31. How does useState work? Provide an example.**  
useState is a hook that lets you add state to a functional component.  
Example:  
```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```
This creates a state variable `count` initialized to 0 and a function `setCount` to update it.

**32. What is useEffect? How would you use it?**  
useEffect is a hook for handling side effects (like data fetching, timers, or subscriptions).  
Example:  
```js
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []);
```
This runs `fetchData` once after the component mounts.

**33. How do you pass data between React components?**  
Data is passed from parent to child using props. To pass data from child to parent or between siblings, you can use callbacks or context.

**34. What is prop drilling? How do you avoid it?**  
Prop drilling is passing data through multiple intermediate components to reach a deeply nested child. You can avoid it using React Context or state management libraries like Redux.

**35. What are controlled and uncontrolled components?**  
Controlled components have their state managed by React (e.g., form inputs with value set by state). Uncontrolled components rely on the DOM to manage their state, accessed via refs.

**36. What is context in React? When would you use it?**  
Context is a way to share data (like theme or user info) globally without passing props through every level. Use it for global state that many components need.

**37. How do you optimize performance in React applications?**  
Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to prevent unnecessary renders, lazy-load components, code splitting, avoid inline functions/objects as props, and keep component trees shallow.

**38. What are React fragments?**  
Fragments (`<></>`) let you group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

**39. What is “lifting state up” in React?**  
Lifting state up means moving shared state to the nearest common ancestor so multiple components can access and update it.

**40. How do you manage side effects in React?**  
By using the useEffect hook to run code after render, and cleaning up with the return function in useEffect.

**41. How do you fetch data in a React app?**  
Use useEffect to trigger data fetching (with fetch/Axios) after component mount or prop changes, updating state with the results.

**42. What are error boundaries in React?**  
Error boundaries are class components that catch JavaScript errors in child components and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole app.

**43. What is React Router and why would you use it?**  
React Router is a routing library for React that enables navigation between pages/components in single-page applications without reloading the page.

**44. How do you handle forms in React?**  
By using controlled components: inputs are bound to state, and updates are managed via onChange handlers. For complex forms, use libraries like Formik or React Hook Form.

**45. How do you test React components?**  
With tools like Jest and React Testing Library, you can write unit and integration tests to render components, simulate user interactions, and assert on output.

**46. How do you handle global state in React?**  
By using Context API, Redux, Zustand, or other state management libraries to store and manage state accessible across components.

**47. What is Redux? Have you used it?**  
Redux is a state management library that uses a single store and actions to manage state changes predictably. Yes, I have used it for managing global state in complex apps.

**48. What are higher-order components (HOCs)?**  
HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with added props or logic. They’re used for code reuse and cross-cutting concerns.

**49. What are render props?**  
Render props are a pattern where a component’s child is a function that receives data and returns JSX, enabling code sharing.

**50. What is memoization in React and how does React.memo work?**  
Memoization caches results to avoid unnecessary recalculations. React.memo is a HOC that prevents re-rendering if props haven't changed.

**51. How do you handle code splitting in React?**  
Use React.lazy and Suspense to load components only when needed, splitting code into smaller bundles.

**52. What are portals in React?**  
Portals let you render children into a DOM node outside the parent component hierarchy. Useful for modals, tooltips, etc.

**53. How do you handle authentication in React applications?**  
Store authentication tokens securely (e.g., in httpOnly cookies), check auth state, protect routes, and handle login/logout flows. Use context or Redux for auth state.

**54. What is server-side rendering in React?**  
SSR renders React components to HTML on the server, sending the fully rendered page to the client for faster load and SEO benefits.

**55. What is hydration in SSR React apps?**  
Hydration is when the client-side JavaScript takes over a server-rendered HTML page, attaching event listeners and making it interactive.

**56. How do you manage assets and static files in React?**  
Place static files in the public folder or import them in components. For images, use the import statement or require, and configure Webpack or Next.js for asset management.

## Next.js – Questions and Answers

**57. What is Next.js? How does it differ from Create React App?**  
Next.js is a React framework for building server-rendered, statically generated, and hybrid web applications. Unlike Create React App (CRA), which provides only a client-side rendered SPA, Next.js supports server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), API routes, and better SEO out of the box.

**58. What are the benefits of using Next.js?**  
- Built-in SSR and SSG for improved performance and SEO  
- File-based routing  
- API routes for backend logic  
- Automatic code splitting  
- Optimized image handling  
- Fast refresh and hot reloading  
- TypeScript support  
- Easy deployment and static exports

**59. Explain the file-based routing system of Next.js.**  
Pages are created by adding React components to the `/pages` directory. The file name and folder structure within `/pages` automatically determine the routes. For example, `pages/about.js` becomes `/about` route.

**60. What is getServerSideProps?**  
A Next.js data-fetching function for SSR. It runs on the server at every request, fetching data and passing it as props to the page component.

**61. What is getStaticProps?**  
A Next.js data-fetching function for SSG. It runs at build time to fetch data and generate static HTML for the page, improving performance.

**62. What is getInitialProps?**  
An older Next.js data-fetching method for both SSR and SSG. It’s now mostly replaced by `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` for better flexibility and performance.

**63. What is ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)?**  
ISR allows you to update static pages after deployment by re-generating them in the background as traffic comes in, without rebuilding the entire site.

**64. How does dynamic routing work in Next.js?**  
Dynamic routes are defined using bracket syntax in the `/pages` directory, e.g., `pages/posts/[id].js` matches `/posts/1`, `/posts/2`, etc.

**65. How do you set up API routes in Next.js?**  
Create JavaScript/TypeScript files inside the `/pages/api` directory. Each file exports a handler function and becomes an API endpoint, e.g., `/api/hello`.

**66. How do you handle redirects and rewrites in Next.js?**  
Use the `next.config.js` file to define `redirects` and `rewrites` arrays, specifying source and destination paths and conditions.

**67. What is the _app.js file used for?**  
`pages/_app.js` is a custom App component that wraps all page components. It’s used to persist layout, add global styles, or provide context providers.

**68. What is the _document.js file used for?**  
`pages/_document.js` customizes the server-rendered HTML document structure, such as adding custom `<html>`, `<body>`, or meta tags.

**69. How do you add global styles in Next.js?**  
Import CSS files (e.g., `import '../styles/globals.css'`) in `pages/_app.js`. You can also use CSS-in-JS libraries or Tailwind CSS.

**70. How do you deploy a Next.js application?**  
You can deploy to Vercel (the creators of Next.js), or to platforms like Netlify, AWS, or your own server. Use `next build` and `next start` for production.

**71. How do you handle environment variables in Next.js?**  
Define them in `.env.local`, `.env.development`, or `.env.production` files. Prefix variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to expose them to the browser.

**72. What is middleware in Next.js?**  
Middleware allows you to run code before a request is completed. It can modify the request/response, handle authentication, redirects, rewrites, etc., by creating a `middleware.js` file in the root or specific folders.

**73. How do you optimize images in Next.js?**  
Use the built-in `<Image />` component, which automatically optimizes, resizes, and loads images efficiently.

**74. What is the Image component in Next.js?**  
A specialized component (`next/image`) for optimized images, supporting lazy loading, resizing, and automatic format selection for performance.

**75. How do you configure custom error pages in Next.js?**  
Create `pages/404.js` for not found pages and `pages/_error.js` for other errors. You can customize the UI and messaging.

**76. How do you manage authentication in Next.js apps?**  
Use libraries like NextAuth.js, handle auth state via context or cookies, protect API routes, and restrict page access using getServerSideProps or middleware.

**77. How do you use Next.js with TypeScript?**  
Rename files to `.tsx`/`.ts`, add a `tsconfig.json`, and run `npx next dev` to auto-generate types. Next.js has built-in TypeScript support.

**78. How do you enable SSR in Next.js?**  
Use `getServerSideProps` in your page component to fetch data on every request and render the page server-side.

**79. How do you integrate a CMS with Next.js?**  
Fetch data from headless CMSes (like Contentful, Strapi, Sanity) using their APIs inside `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`, then pass it as props to your components.

**80. How do you create a multi-language site in Next.js?**  
Use Next.js built-in i18n routing in `next.config.js`, or libraries like `next-i18next`, to manage translations and localized routes.

**81. How does Next.js handle static assets?**  
Place assets (images, fonts, etc.) in the `/public` folder, then reference them with `/path/to/asset` in your code.

**82. How do you handle SEO in Next.js?**  
Use SSR/SSG for better crawlability, set meta tags and Open Graph data in the `<Head>` component, use `next/head`, and optimize page performance.


## Tailwind CSS – Questions and Answers

**83. What is Tailwind CSS and how does it work?**  
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework where you compose designs directly in your markup using utility classes. It generates utility classes for most CSS properties, allowing rapid development and customization without writing custom CSS.

**84. How do you set up Tailwind CSS in a project?**  
Install Tailwind via npm (`npm install tailwindcss`), generate the config file (`npx tailwindcss init`), add Tailwind’s directives (`@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;`) to your CSS, and configure your build process (PostCSS, Next.js, etc.) to process Tailwind.

**85. What are utility-first CSS frameworks?**  
They provide low-level utility classes for each CSS property (e.g., `p-4`, `bg-blue-500`), encouraging you to build custom UIs by composing these classes in your HTML rather than writing custom CSS.

**86. What are the advantages of using Tailwind CSS?**  
- Rapid prototyping and development  
- Highly customizable  
- Consistent design through config  
- Removes unused CSS in production (small bundle size)  
- Responsive and state variants out of the box

**87. How do you customize Tailwind’s default configuration?**  
Modify the `tailwind.config.js` file to add or override theme values (colors, spacing, fonts), enable plugins, define custom variants, or extend the default configuration.

**88. How do you create custom components with Tailwind CSS?**  
Compose utility classes in HTML/JSX elements or group them using `@apply` in a custom CSS class for reusability.

**89. What are Tailwind CSS plugins?**  
Plugins are extensions that add extra utilities, components, or functionality (e.g., forms, typography, aspect-ratio). You can use official or community plugins or write your own.

**90. How do you handle responsive design in Tailwind CSS?**  
Use responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:`) to apply utility classes at specific breakpoints (e.g., `md:text-lg` for large text on medium screens and up).

**91. How does Tailwind’s JIT (Just-in-Time) engine work?**  
The JIT engine generates styles on-demand as you use them in your code, resulting in a much faster build and smaller CSS files since only used classes are generated.

**92. How do you manage dark mode with Tailwind?**  
Enable the `darkMode` option in `tailwind.config.js` (either `'media'` or `'class'`). Use `dark:` variants (e.g., `dark:bg-gray-800`) to style elements in dark mode.

**93. How do you extend Tailwind with custom utilities?**  
Add custom utilities in the `extend` section of `tailwind.config.js` under `theme`, or use the `addUtilities`/`addComponents` functions in the `plugins` array.

**94. How do you optimize your Tailwind CSS build for production?**  
Configure PurgeCSS (built into Tailwind) to remove unused classes, use the JIT engine, and minify the final CSS. Set `NODE_ENV=production` to trigger these optimizations.

**95. How do you use Tailwind with React or Next.js?**  
Install Tailwind as a dependency, configure PostCSS, import Tailwind’s CSS in your main entry file (e.g., `index.js` or `_app.js`), and use Tailwind classes directly in your JSX.

**96. What are the pros and cons of using Tailwind CSS?**  
**Pros:** Faster development, customizable, responsive utilities, small production CSS, consistent design.  
**Cons:** Cluttered HTML, learning curve for class names, less semantic class naming, potential overuse of utility classes.

**97. How do you handle theming in Tailwind CSS?**  
Define custom themes in `tailwind.config.js` (colors, fonts, etc.), use CSS variables, or leverage plugins like `@tailwindcss/themes` for multiple themes/dark mode.

**98. How do you structure class names for maintainability in Tailwind CSS?**  
Group related classes, use logical ordering (layout, spacing, colors, typography), leverage `@apply` for reusable styles, and avoid excessive repetition.

**99. How do you use Tailwind to create pixel-perfect designs from Figma?**  
Match Figma’s design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) with Tailwind’s config, use Figma’s inspect panel to get exact values, and apply corresponding utility classes for precise alignment and styling.


## Figma and Pixel-Perfect UI – Questions and Answers

**100. How do you translate a Figma design into code?**  
First, I analyze the Figma layout, break it down into reusable components, and structure my code accordingly. I use the provided design specs for spacing, colors, and typography, and implement them using CSS frameworks or custom styles, ensuring each UI element matches the Figma prototype.

**101. What tools do you use to extract assets from Figma?**  
I use Figma’s built-in export features to extract images, SVGs, and icons. For more complex assets, plugins like “Figmify,” “SVG Export,” or “Zeplin” help to generate optimized code or assets.

**102. How do you ensure pixel-perfect accuracy?**  
I use Figma’s inspect tools to get exact values for spacing, font sizes, and colors. I often overlay the design on the implemented UI (using browser extensions or Figma plugins like “PerfectPixel”) to spot discrepancies and correct them.

**103. What are common challenges when implementing designs from Figma?**  
Common challenges include inconsistent design specs, missing states (like hovers or actives), responsive behavior not fully defined, font mismatches, and handling export of complex assets like SVGs or icons.

**104. How do you handle typography and spacing from Figma in code?**  
I copy all font families, sizes, weights, and line heights from Figma’s inspect panel and define them in CSS or design tokens. For spacing, I use the exact margin and padding values, often leveraging CSS variables or utility classes for consistency.

**105. How do you communicate with designers to clarify design ambiguities?**  
I reach out via Slack, comments in Figma, or standup meetings to ask for clarification on unclear elements, missing states, or responsive behaviors. Open communication helps ensure the implementation matches the designer’s vision.

**106. What is the importance of design tokens?**  
Design tokens provide a single source of truth for colors, typography, spacing, and other design properties. They ensure consistency across the project, simplify changes, and make it easy to implement themes or maintain design systems.

**107. How do you use rem, em, and px units for pixel-perfect layouts?**  
I use `rem` for font sizes and scalable spacing to ensure accessibility and scalability, `em` for relative sizing within components, and `px` for elements that require strict pixel alignment. This balance maintains pixel accuracy while supporting responsiveness.

**108. How do you handle SVGs and icons from Figma?**  
I export SVGs directly from Figma, clean up the markup if necessary, and use them as inline SVGs or as React components for better control. For icon sets, I use libraries or create custom icon components.

**109. How do you manage responsive breakpoints from design files?**  
I check the Figma file for defined breakpoints and layouts for different devices. If not specified, I collaborate with designers to establish breakpoints, then implement them using CSS media queries or Tailwind’s responsive utility classes.


## Design Systems – Questions and Answers

**110. What is a design system?**  
A design system is a collection of reusable components, patterns, guidelines, and standards that define the visual and functional aspects of a product's user interface. It typically includes documentation for colors, typography, spacing, components, and usage principles.

**111. Why are design systems important?**  
Design systems ensure consistency across products, speed up development, improve collaboration between designers and developers, and make it easier to scale and maintain large applications.

**112. How do you use a design system in your projects?**  
I use the provided components, styles, and guidelines from the design system to build consistent UIs. I reference documentation for usage patterns and adopt tokens or libraries for colors, fonts, and spacing.

**113. What are some popular design systems you have used?**  
Popular design systems include Google’s Material Design, IBM Carbon, Atlassian’s Atlaskit, Microsoft Fluent UI, and Ant Design. I have used Material UI and Ant Design in React projects.

**114. How do you implement a custom design system?**  
I start by defining tokens (colors, spacing, typography), create a style guide, build reusable components, write documentation, and involve both designers and developers for feedback and iteration.

**115. How do you ensure consistency using a design system?**  
By strictly using the system’s components and tokens, conducting regular code reviews, enforcing linting/style rules, and updating documentation as needed.

**116. How do you document a design system?**  
With clear, accessible documentation that includes usage guidelines, code examples, dos and don’ts, and live component previews—often using tools like Storybook or a dedicated documentation site.

**117. How do you handle updates to a design system?**  
I version the design system, communicate changes to the team, provide migration guides, and ensure backward compatibility or clear upgrade paths for existing projects.

**118. How do you integrate a component library?**  
Install the library as a dependency, import components as needed, customize them with themes or overrides, and follow the library’s guidelines and best practices.

**119. How do you create reusable components?**  
I build components to be modular, configurable with props, and style them consistently using design tokens. I write clear documentation and add tests to ensure reliability.

**120. What are atomic design principles?**  
Atomic design breaks UI down into five levels: atoms (basic elements), molecules (combinations of atoms), organisms (groups of molecules), templates (page-level structures), and pages (specific instances). This approach encourages reusability and scalability.

## REST APIs – Questions and Answers

**121. What is a REST API?**  
A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building web services that allow clients to communicate with servers using stateless HTTP requests to access and manipulate resources.

**122. How do you consume REST APIs in React or Next.js?**  
You consume REST APIs by making HTTP requests using `fetch`, `axios`, or similar libraries inside React components (often in `useEffect` hooks). In Next.js, you can also fetch data in data-fetching methods like `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps`.

**123. What are common HTTP methods used with REST APIs?**  
- `GET` – Retrieve data  
- `POST` – Create new data  
- `PUT` – Update existing data (replaces entire resource)  
- `PATCH` – Partially update a resource  
- `DELETE` – Remove data

**124. How do you handle API errors in the frontend?**  
Check the API response status and handle errors gracefully by displaying user-friendly messages, logging errors, and optionally retrying the request or providing fallback UI.

**125. How do you secure sensitive data when working with REST APIs?**  
Never expose secrets in frontend code. Store sensitive data (like API keys) on the server, use HTTPS, implement authentication and authorization, and validate all inputs on the backend.

**126. How do you handle authentication tokens in API requests?**  
Store tokens securely (preferably in HTTP-only cookies or in-memory), add them to request headers (usually `Authorization: Bearer <token>`), and refresh them when expired. Avoid storing tokens in localStorage if possible due to XSS risks.

**127. What tools do you use to test REST APIs?**  
Postman, Insomnia, curl, and browser DevTools for manual testing. For automated testing, I use Jest, Supertest, or integration tests in Cypress.

**128. How do you handle API versioning?**  
By including the version number in the API URL (e.g., `/api/v1/users`) or in headers. This allows you to make breaking changes without affecting existing clients.

**129. How do you deal with large API responses?**  
Implement pagination, infinite scroll, or lazy loading to fetch and display data in chunks. For large data, use compression (like gzip) and only request needed fields.

**130. How do you cache API responses?**  
Use browser cache, service workers, or libraries like SWR or React Query for client-side caching. Leverage HTTP cache headers (`Cache-Control`, `ETag`) on the server.

**131. How do you test your API integration?**  
Write integration tests to ensure frontend and backend work together, mock API responses in unit tests, and use tools like React Testing Library or Cypress to simulate real user interactions.

**132. How do you structure API calls in your frontend code?**  
Organize API calls in separate utility files or services, abstracting endpoints into functions. Use hooks (like `useFetch` or custom hooks) for code reuse and maintainability.

**133. How do you handle loading and error states when fetching data?**  
Use state variables to track loading (`isLoading`), error (`error`), and data. Show spinners or skeletons during loading and meaningful error messages on failure.

**134. How do you optimize API requests for performance?**  
Debounce or throttle requests, batch requests, cache responses, avoid unnecessary requests, and use efficient query parameters to request only needed data.

**135. How do you handle CORS issues?**  
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is handled on the server by setting appropriate headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`). For development, use proxy servers or configure the backend to allow requests from your frontend’s origin.

## Unit & Feature Testing – Questions and Answers

**136. What are unit tests and why are they important?**  
Unit tests are automated tests that verify the correctness of individual functions, modules, or components in isolation. They are important because they catch bugs early, ensure code reliability, and make refactoring safer.

**137. What testing frameworks have you used? (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library)**  
I have used Jest for running and structuring tests, React Testing Library for testing React components, and sometimes Enzyme, Mocha, or Cypress for end-to-end and integration testing.

**138. How do you write a unit test for a React component?**  
I use Jest and React Testing Library to render the component, simulate interactions or provide props, and then assert on the expected output or behavior.  
_Example:_  
```js
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import MyButton from './MyButton';

test('renders button with correct text', () => {
  render(<MyButton>Click me</MyButton>);
  expect(screen.getByText('Click me')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

**139. What are feature tests (integration tests)?**  
Feature or integration tests verify that multiple units or components work together as expected, covering user flows or features end-to-end (e.g., submitting a form and seeing the result).

**140. How do you test user interactions in a UI?**  
I use React Testing Library or Cypress to simulate user actions like clicks, typing, or form submissions, and then assert on the UI changes or output.

**141. How do you mock API responses in your tests?**  
I use libraries like Jest’s `jest.mock`, MSW (Mock Service Worker), or manually mock fetch/axios to provide fake API responses during tests.

**142. What is the difference between shallow and deep rendering?**  
Shallow rendering renders a component without its child components (testing it in isolation), while deep (full) rendering renders the component along with all its children, allowing complete integration testing.

**143. How do you achieve test coverage?**  
By writing tests for all critical code paths, branches, and edge cases, and using coverage tools (like Jest’s coverage report) to identify untested code.

**144. How do you run tests in your development workflow?**  
I run tests automatically on file changes (watch mode), as a pre-commit hook (e.g., with Husky), and as part of CI pipelines to ensure code quality before merging.

**145. How do you write tests for asynchronous code?**  
Use async/await or return promises in test functions, and use `waitFor` or similar helpers in React Testing Library to wait for UI updates after async actions.

**146. What is snapshot testing?**  
Snapshot testing saves a rendered output of a component and compares it to future runs. If the output changes unexpectedly, the test fails, helping to detect unintentional UI changes.

**147. How do you test error boundaries?**  
Render a component that throws an error inside an error boundary, then assert that the fallback UI is displayed instead of the crashed component.

**148. How do you debug failing tests?**  
Read error messages, use `console.log` or debugging tools, inspect stack traces, and isolate the failing test. Sometimes I use `.only` to run a single test or `.skip` to ignore others temporarily.

**149. What are best practices for writing maintainable tests?**  
- Keep tests isolated and deterministic  
- Use clear, descriptive names  
- Avoid testing implementation details  
- Reuse setup code with helpers  
- Clean up after each test  
- Regularly review and refactor tests

**150. How do you test styled components or CSS-in-JS?**  
Test that the component renders with the correct class names or styles. For more advanced checks, use tools like `jest-styled-components` to assert on specific style rules.

## Git & Team Collaboration – Questions and Answers

**151. What is Git and why is it important for developers?**  
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code. It helps developers collaborate, manage code history, and revert or branch work safely.

**152. What is a branch in Git?**  
A branch is an independent line of development, letting you work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.

**153. What is the difference between git merge and git rebase?**  
`git merge` combines changes from one branch into another, preserving history and creating a merge commit. `git rebase` moves or combines commits from one branch onto another, creating a linear history by rewriting commit history.

**154. How do you resolve merge conflicts?**  
Open conflicting files, manually resolve the issues, mark the conflict as resolved (`git add`), and then complete the merge with `git commit`.

**155. How do you use pull requests?**  
Create a pull request to propose changes from one branch to another (usually feature to main). Team members review, discuss, and approve the changes before merging.

**156. How do you review code in a team setting?**  
Review pull requests by checking code quality, logic, tests, and adherence to guidelines. Leave constructive feedback, suggest improvements, and approve or request changes.

**157. What is git stash and when would you use it?**  
`git stash` temporarily saves uncommitted changes, allowing you to switch branches or pull updates without losing work. Retrieve the changes later with `git stash pop`.

**158. How do you handle versioning and releases?**  
Follow semantic versioning (major.minor.patch), tag release commits, and maintain change logs. Use branching strategies for stable releases.

**159. What is a commit message convention?**  
A set of rules for writing clear, descriptive commit messages, e.g., [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format: `feat: add login button`, `fix: correct typo in header`.

**160. How do you revert a commit?**  
Use `git revert <commit-hash>` to create a new commit that undoes the changes of a previous commit.

**161. How do you cherry-pick a commit?**  
Use `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>` to apply a specific commit from one branch onto your current branch.

**162. How do you squash commits?**  
During a rebase (`git rebase -i`), mark commits as `squash` or `fixup` to combine multiple commits into one for a cleaner history.

**163. How do you handle large binary files in Git?**  
Use Git Large File Storage (LFS) to manage large binaries, keeping pointers in the repo and storing the actual files separately.

**164. How do you manage access permissions in a Git repo?**  
Configure permissions via Git hosting platforms (GitHub, GitLab) by managing team roles, protected branches, and access control lists.

**165. How do you use Git hooks?**  
Git hooks are scripts that run at certain Git events (like pre-commit, pre-push) to automate tasks such as linting, formatting, or running tests before code is committed or pushed.

**166. What is the difference between Git and SVN?**  
Git is distributed (each user has a full repo), while SVN is centralized (single server). Git enables offline work, branching, and merging more easily and robustly than SVN.

**167. How do you handle code reviews and feedback?**  
Review code through pull requests, provide constructive feedback, discuss changes, and iterate until approval. Encourage open communication and knowledge sharing.

**168. How do you manage release branches?**  
Create dedicated branches for releases (e.g., `release/v1.0.0`), apply hotfixes or bug fixes to them, and merge necessary changes back into main and develop branches.

**169. How do you handle CI/CD integration with Git?**  
Integrate CI/CD tools (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) to automatically build, test, and deploy code on pushes or pull requests, ensuring code quality and faster releases.

**170. How do you use Git in a monorepo setup?**  
Organize multiple projects in one repository, use tools like Lerna or Nx for managing packages, and leverage branching and CI/CD workflows to handle code across projects efficiently.

**171. How do you document your Git workflow for teams?**  
Create and maintain clear documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING.md, or a separate docs site) outlining branching strategies, commit conventions, pull request processes, and release management.

## TypeScript (Bonus) – Questions and Answers

**172. What is TypeScript and why is it used?**  
TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds type annotations and type checking. It’s used to catch errors at compile-time, improve code quality, and enhance developer productivity.

**173. How do you set up TypeScript in a React or Next.js project?**  
For React, run `npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript` or add TypeScript to an existing project with `npm install --save typescript @types/react @types/react-dom` and rename files to `.tsx`. For Next.js, run `npx create-next-app my-app --typescript` or add TypeScript and required types, then restart the dev server to auto-generate `tsconfig.json`.

**174. What are the benefits of using TypeScript?**  
- Early detection of errors  
- Better code documentation and autocompletion  
- Safer refactoring  
- Enforced contracts in large codebases  
- Improved maintainability and collaboration

**175. What are interfaces and types in TypeScript?**  
Both are used to describe the shape of data. `interface` defines object shapes and can be extended, while `type` can alias any valid type, including primitives, unions, and intersections. Interfaces are typically preferred for object structures.

**176. How do you type React props and state?**  
Define interfaces or types for props and state, then use them as generics:  
```tsx
interface MyProps { title: string; }
const MyComponent: React.FC<MyProps> = ({ title }) => <h1>{title}</h1>;
```
For state, use `useState<Type>()`.

**177. What is type inference in TypeScript?**  
TypeScript automatically infers types based on assigned values, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.

**178. How do you handle third-party libraries without type definitions?**  
Install community types from DefinitelyTyped (e.g., `npm i --save-dev @types/library`). If unavailable, use `declare module 'library-name';` or define custom types as needed.

**179. How do you use generics in TypeScript?**  
Generics provide reusable components or functions that work with any data type.  
```ts
function identity<T>(arg: T): T { return arg; }
```

**180. What are union and intersection types?**  
Union types (`A | B`) allow a value to be one of several types. Intersection types (`A & B`) combine multiple types into one.

**181. What is type assertion?**  
Type assertion tells TypeScript to treat a value as a specific type, overriding its inferred type.  
```ts
const input = document.getElementById('myInput') as HTMLInputElement;
```

**182. How do you handle enums in TypeScript?**  
Enums define a set of named constants.  
```ts
enum Color { Red, Green, Blue }
let c: Color = Color.Green;
```

**183. How do you migrate a JavaScript codebase to TypeScript?**  
Rename files to `.ts`/`.tsx`, fix type errors incrementally, add type annotations, and enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json` for gradual adoption.

**184. How do you handle null and undefined in TypeScript?**  
Use union types (e.g., `string | null`), strict null checks, and optional chaining (`obj?.prop`). TypeScript flags possible null/undefined errors at compile time.

**185. How do you use utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit, etc.)?**  
Utility types help manipulate types:  
- `Partial<T>`: All properties optional  
- `Pick<T, K>`: Select specific properties  
- `Omit<T, K>`: Exclude specific properties  
- `Record<K, T>`: Map properties

**186. How do you write type-safe API calls in TypeScript?**  
Define interfaces/types for request and response data, use them in fetch/axios calls, and enforce types with generics or response type annotations for compile-time safety.


## Performance Optimization (Bonus) – Questions and Answers

**187. What are common performance bottlenecks in frontend apps?**  
- Large JavaScript bundles  
- Unoptimized images  
- Too many or unnecessary re-renders  
- Inefficient DOM updates

- Memory leaks  
- Inefficient data fetching and rendering large lists

**188. How do you profile the performance of a React app?**  
Use browser DevTools to analyze rendering, network, and memory usage. Use React DevTools Profiler to measure component render times and find performance bottlenecks.

**189. How do you use React’s Profiler?**  
Enable the Profiler tab in React DevTools, wrap components with `<Profiler>` or profile the whole app. Use the reports to analyze render durations, commit counts, and identify slow or frequently updated components.

**190. What is code splitting and how does it improve performance?**  
Code splitting breaks the app into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand. This reduces initial load time and improves performance by only loading code needed for the current page.

**191. How do you lazy load components?**  
Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to load components dynamically:
```js
const MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));
```
Wrap with `<Suspense>` for fallback UI.

**192. What is memoization and how does it help performance?**  
Memoization caches the results of expensive function calls. In React, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `React.memo` prevent unnecessary recalculations and re-renders when props or dependencies haven’t changed.

**193. How do you optimize images and assets?**  
- Use responsive and appropriately sized images  
- Compress images (WebP, JPEG)  
- Use lazy loading

Tree shaking is a build optimization that removes unused code from the final bundle, reducing bundle size. Tools like Webpack and Rollup support tree shaking for ES modules.

**196. How do you debounce or throttle expensive operations?**  
- Debounce: Delay execution until a function hasn’t been called for a certain time (useful for input events).  
- Throttle: Limit execution to once every specified interval (useful for scroll/resize events).  
Use libraries like Lodash (`_.debounce`, `_.throttle`) or custom hooks.

**197. How do you optimize rendering of large lists?**  
Use virtualization libraries (e.g., `react-window`, `react-virtualized`) to render only visible list items, reducing DOM nodes and improving performance.

**198. How do you use the browser’s cache for performance?**  
Leverage HTTP cache headers (`Cache-Control`, `ETag`), service workers for offline caching, and cache static assets for repeat visits.

**199. How do you analyze and improve Time to First Byte (TTFB)?**  
Measure TTFB using browser DevTools or performance monitoring tools. Improve TTFB by optimizing server response time, using CDNs, and reducing backend processing.

**200. How do you prevent memory leaks in React apps?**  
Clean up subscriptions, timers, and event listeners in `useEffect` cleanup functions. Avoid retaining references to DOM nodes or large objects. Use profiling tools to detect leaks.

## CI/CD Workflows (Bonus) – Questions and Answers

Configure the CI workflow (e.g., YAML file) to run test commands (like `npm test` or `yarn test`) on every push or pull request. Failing tests block merges or deployments.

**205. How do you deploy a frontend app with CI/CD?**  
Set up steps in the CI/CD pipeline to build the app (e.g., `npm run build`) and then deploy artifacts to hosting platforms like Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3, or server environments.

**206. How do you handle environment variables and secrets in CI/CD?**  
Store sensitive data in secure environment variable managers provided by the CI/CD tool (e.g., GitHub Secrets, GitLab CI Variables). Never hardcode secrets in code or config files.

**207. How do you automate linting and formatting in CI/CD?**  
Add steps in the workflow to run linting (e.g., `npm run lint`) and formatting checks. Fail the build if lint or format errors are detected.

**208. What are best practices for building robust CI/CD workflows?**  
- Run tests and linting on every change  
- Use caching to speed up builds  
- Keep pipelines fast and reliable  
- Use separate jobs for build, test, and deploy  
- Notify teams of failures  
- Version artifacts and track deployments

**209. How do you handle rollbacks in CI/CD?**  
Maintain previous build artifacts or use deployment platforms that support rollbacks (e.g., Vercel, Netlify “previous deploys”). Automate rollback commands in the pipeline.

**210. How do you monitor deployments for errors?**  
Integrate error tracking tools (e.g., Sentry, Datadog), monitor deployment logs, use health checks, and set up alerts for failed deploys or runtime errors.

**211. How do you use feature flags in deployment workflows?**  
Implement feature flags using libraries or services (e.g., LaunchDarkly, Unleash). Control feature rollout post-deployment without code changes, enabling gradual releases and quick rollbacks.

**212. How do you manage staging vs production environments?**  
Set up separate pipelines and environments for staging and production. Use different environment variables, secrets, and branch protection rules. Test in staging before promoting to production.

## Scalable UI Projects (Bonus) – Questions and Answers

**213. What is scalability in UI projects?**  
Scalability in UI projects means the ability of a codebase and architecture to handle growth in features, team size, and user base without loss of performance, maintainability, or stability.

**214. How do you structure a large frontend codebase?**  
Use feature-based or domain-driven folder structure, separate concerns (components, hooks, utils, services), modularize code, and use clear naming conventions.

**215. How do you handle code splitting in large apps?**  
Leverage dynamic imports, React.lazy, and route-based or component-level code splitting to load only what’s needed, improving performance.
